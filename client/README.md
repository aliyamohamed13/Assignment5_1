Postings Website… Continued!
For the third assignment, you’ll be adding more functionality to your postings website, now with
Node and Express! It will build on the previous assignment, so start from your completed
assignment 2, and begin to incorporate the requirements below.
We’re expecting the following:
1) You MUST use Node AND Express (Express App Generator is acceptable), and start
your assignment from your completed assignment 2. Remember, you will be asked to
explain sections of your code.
2) The initial data (initial set of messages) should be loaded using a GET request to your
server
3) You can add a new question using a PUT or POST request
4) One additional server request of your choice. Examples could be:
○ Editing an existing question
○ Clearing the list of questions
○ Getting details for a question
5) You will need to handle the calls asynchronously (because they’re asynchronous calls).
You can either do this in a component or in an action. If you want to use it in an action,
you’ll need to use redux-thunk, which is the standard way to do it. It is a bit more
advanced, however, so if you don’t feel confident, just make the call from the
component.
6) Something cool and extra! This is wide open for you to explore, and try to push your
knowledge and boundaries.
For example:
- Some kind of new component
- A spinner while making a request (until it finishes)
- Some more advanced styling (animations or transition)
- As listed above, editing a question
As described in the individual assignment rubric, your code will need to meet these
requirements and be functional, up to perhaps a few minor glitches in tricky cases. Note that
functionality includes both user-visible and console-visible issues.
It’s up to you! We’re hoping that you’ll use the above requirements as a guide, but that you’ll let
your imagination take over, and build something unique and interesting!
You should be ready to demo this to a TA during your second week lab, and should be ready to
answer questions about it, as well as explaining what you’ve done.
